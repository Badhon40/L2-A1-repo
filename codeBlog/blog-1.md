firstly a function called sumArray taken, which will return sum of the elements of a number array in number type.

then use a for loop and traverse the entire array and counting each element and store in Sum variale. and finaly return sum.

If i call  sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), the function will:

Start with sum = 0
Add each number: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
Finally, it returns 15.
