this problem is to filter array elemnts .

a function called removeDuplicates from a array of number and return a array , where all the duplicate element will be removed.
 to solve this problem i used Filter method from ES6, where two parameter is called, value and indexs, check each value with another one..


 But there is also a process, in simple one,
  we can split the array, then, 
  check each element with the rest ones, this the conditon get success we will push that element in a new array, and print that array.
  the process will follow recursion method.
